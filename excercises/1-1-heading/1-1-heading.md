You are free to add anything you wish to this page but use h2-h6

Note: It is a good practice to only have one h1 tag in a page.

4. Save your HTML file and open it in a web browser to see how the headings create a structured hierarchy on your webpage.

This exercise is designed to help us practice creating a simple webpage with different heading levels. It demonstrates how to use <h1> for the main topic and progressively smaller headings for subsections, illustrating the hierarchy of headings in HTML documents.

Goodluck and have fun!!!
